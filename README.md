The 1D final file runs as a standalone code to demonstrate the propagation of an EM wave across a material with a simple absorbing boundary layer
The simulation file is a simulation of an electromagnetic wave in two spatial dimensions with a black hole metamaterial in the centre of the domain and a PML absorbing boundary layer. The geometries for the black hole and boundary layer are read from the csv files which can be produced using the respective files.
There is a choice of two EM sources depending on which cell is run for the update function, a regular source coming from "infinity", and a sinusoidal source placed on the photon sphere.
